# Real-time Indian Sign Language Translator (converts sign to audio/text/videos and vice versa)
Samvaad aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community using Indian Sign Language (ISL) and spoken language users by developing technology that converts spoken language to ISL accurately.
Impact on Access: Deaf individuals struggle to access vital information and participate fully in society, especially in education and healthcare, due to the absence of audio to ISL conversion.
It uses speech recognition, NLP, and computer vision to transcribe audio, interpret it, and generate real-time ISL gestures, enabling seamless communication between the deaf and non-signing individuals while prioritizing accuracy, user-friendliness, and adaptability to regional ISL variations.
